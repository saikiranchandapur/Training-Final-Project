# Description
Developed a lightweight IoT monitoring system using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) over UDP for efficient communication in constrained environments. Implemented a server on BeagleBone Black interfaced with a DHT11 sensor to provide real-time environmental data to remote clients via CoAP GET requests. The project demonstrates embedded networking, GPIO interfacing, socket programming, and low-power IoT system design.
